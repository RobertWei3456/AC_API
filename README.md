# AC_API
Alarm Classification API
sound_classification_project

The aim of this project is aiming at classify 10 different classes of alarms in complex environment, which contain our product of detecting water leak alarm. however, the challenge is, in everyday life, there's thounsand, maybe millions of sound around us. So this project aimed at developing a artifical intelligence system (aka. deep learing model) which can quickly indentify and classify the alarm type when the specific alarm sound is on.

Now the code can indentify from these following sound alarms:

               "clock_alarm",
               "car_alarm",
               "old_alarm",
               "siren_alarm",
               "iphone_alarm",
               "door_bell",      
               "beep_alarm",
               "fire_alram",
               "smoke_alarms",
               "water_alarm"

## How to use:
1. put the *.wav file in 'wav_to_be_classified' fileholder (strongly recommend using those files in 'wav_can_be_used' fileholder)
2. run AC_API.py, the result should show up


## Input:

*.wav file （please be short, idealy less tha 3 seconds）
please put the wav file in 'wav_to_be_classified' fileholder

## Recommended Input file:
all those file in 'wav_can_be_used' fileholder


Thank you!
